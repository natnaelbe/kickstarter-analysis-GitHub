# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
We are looking through Louise's play and how it is represented in a variety of ways utilizing multiple grids.
### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
I followed the steps based on the modules and I believe the modules help guide me in completing my tasks. The examples including the videos provided helped me accomplish my goal in completing this challenge. One of the challenging aspects about this assignment were the errors I received. One of the responses to the multiple choice questions did not appear in any of the options, so I had to ask classmates for clarification until I figured out my mistake. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
How I accomplished this was through following an outline provided in the module and assuring that the images provided matched my findings.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I accessed the countifs function for columns B, C, and D. I then performed arithmetic on columns E, F, G, and H. Then, I uploaded my chart where my results were visually displayed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Applying the functional operations from the examples provided.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The successful outcomes were significantly greater than the failed outcomes.
2. Live performances only occurred for the first three months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The percentage amount of successful goals outweighed failed goals.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

It would be better to represent the same data in a different type of graph. For example, a line graph and a pie chart can be represented for the same data to stand out.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

A pie chart demonstrating the percentages, a venn diagram could be possible to look at overlapping data.
